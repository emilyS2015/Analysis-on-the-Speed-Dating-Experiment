The dataset that we have chosen to analyze is the Speed Dating Experiment dataset available on Kaggle.com. The data was collected by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from multiple speed dating sessions, in which students participated, conducted at Columbia University between 2002 and 2004. According to Kaggle, this is how the data was collected: \begin{displayquote} During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. \end{displayquote}

Our project will focus on the participants' initial ratings that they received from each partner on the 6 attributes as well as the demographic information of each participant. The demographic information we have for each participant includes gender, race, age, field of study, goals for participating in the speed dating event, dating tendencies, going-out tendencies, intended career, and the activities that the participants enjoy. Our ultimate goal is to discover what features of a participant make him/her more likely to receive a match (whether or not the participant's partner wants to see him/her again) from each of his/her partners on the night of the event and if these features are different between men and women.
