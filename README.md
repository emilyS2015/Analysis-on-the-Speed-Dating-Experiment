Our project aims to create a shiny application to analyze twitter data pulled from Twitter API from several perspectives. First, we analyze the state top words related to the word input by a user. Furthermore, in the first output tab, the user can choose to "show the city tweet trend", which will display a table of the most popular words of the chosen city. The number slide bar enables the user to choose the number of tweets wanted. In all, the first tab enables the user to get a basic idea of what words are mostly related to his/her desired keyword as well as the top keywords of a specific city.
